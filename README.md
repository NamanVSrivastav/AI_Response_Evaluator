# AI_Response_Evaluator
This project implements an AI-powered WebSocket-based system that evaluates the quality of student responses to AI-related questions in real-time. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to evaluate the similarity between a given question and the response and provides feedback based on that evaluation.
